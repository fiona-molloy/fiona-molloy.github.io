My teaching topics of interest include both courses within cognitive neuroscience and psychology, and in methods coiurses, such as research methods and statistics--with a particular interest in introductory statistics and analysis courses for social science majors. My teaching approach involves active learning and consistent practice applying the concepts in both psychology-focused and methods-focused courses. I have experience of the instructor of record for a large, general education introductory psychology course (PSYCH 1100 at OSU) and as a graduate course assistant for the introductory statistics course for the social sciences (PSCYH 2220). Here is a link to one of my previous syllabi for PSYCH 1100.
