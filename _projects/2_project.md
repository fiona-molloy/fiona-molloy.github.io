Cognitive models are mathematical frameworks providing a quantitative account of cognitive mechanisms underlying an individualâ€™s behavior. This line of research has followed three key areas: 1. approaches towards constraining cognitive models for more reliable estimates, 2. leveraging joint models to uncover mechanisms central to conflict processing, and 3. applying cognitive modeling frameworks to study delay discounting. Overall, modeling can  psychometric properties of behavior and uncovers distinct cognitive processes that relate to individual differences.
