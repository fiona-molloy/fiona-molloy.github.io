Task-based fMRI is a critical innovation in cognitive neuroscience that provides a window into the neural activation within an individual while they perform a cognitive task. The line of research  has focused on improving the methodology for extracting neural activation both within-individuals and across large groups to investigate the neural basis of executive function, including response inhibition and working memory.
