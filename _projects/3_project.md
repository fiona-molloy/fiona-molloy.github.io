Previous research has revealed that connectivity patterns in youth are linked to behavior, cognition, and psychopathology. However, identifying robust brain-behavior relationships requires large sample sizes, and sophisticated analysis techniques (such as appropriate cross-validation and multivariate methods that can capture complex, distributed brain patterns) to pick up on small effect sizes, while ensuring generalizability to other samples. The ABCD Study is an ideal dataset to answer questions testing the relationship between connectivity and cognition in adolescence due to its large sample size of over 11,000 adolescents, and extensive battery of neural, behavioral, and health-related data. This line of work utilizes the large ABCD samples, alongside other large samples such as HCP, demonstrates the close relationship between the adolescent connectome and a wide range of interconnected outcomes such as cognition, sleep, and psychopathology.
