The brain is organized into distinct, distributed intrinsic networks that can be characterized within an individual using resting state functional connectivity. These networks support information processing, and individualized networks predict individual differences in behavior, cognition, and psychopathology. My dissertation work focused on investigating network organization in newborns and adolescents, and predicting task-based activation from network organization in adults. Currently, I am interested in the development of these networks over time, and how individual differences in developmental trajectory can predict behavior and are impacted by the environment (e.g., substance use, sleep).
